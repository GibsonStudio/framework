		<p>Mans early attempts at powered flight were thwarted by the lack of a suitable engine to provide the necessary power.</p>	
		
		<div class="heading">The Steam Engine</div>
		
		<div class="keypoint right">Steam Engines are very inefficient.</div>
		
		<p>The steam engine, which was invented in the early 1700 was heavy and inefficient. Because combustion took place outside of
		the engine it was termed an ‘external combustion engine’. Over 90% of the heat energy produced in the steam engine was wasted.</p>

		<div class="heading">The Internal Combustion Engine</div>
		
		<p>In the late 19th century Dr Nicolaus August Otto succeeded in producing a working engine based on the internal combustion principle.
		The engine operates by inducing a mixture of air and fuel into a cylinder, through an inlet valve, which is automatically opened and closed
		at the appropriate times.</p>

		<p>The mixture is then compressed by a piston.</p>
 
		<p>The mixture is ignited by an electrical spark.</p>
		
		<p>The rapid rise in temperature causes the gas pressure in the cylinder to rise forcing the piston down the cylinder.</p>
		
		<p>Linear movement of the piston is converted into rotary motion by a connecting rod and crankshaft.</p>

		<div class="heading clearfix">Categories of Internal Combustion Engine</div>
		
		<p>Internal Combustion Engines have developed into three main categories:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Compression ignition or diesel engines.</li>
			<li>Wankel rotary engines.</li>
			<li>Two and four stroke spark ignition engines.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="heading">This Course</div>

		<p>This course covers in detail the construction and operation of the four stroke reciprocating engine which is commonly used in aviation,
		and is generally referred to as the Piston Engine.</p>

		<p>In this lesson we shall look at some of the terms and definitions and laws that you need to be conversant with in order to understand the
		operation of the piston engine. We will begin by defining the terms ‘force’, ‘work’ and ‘power’.</p>
