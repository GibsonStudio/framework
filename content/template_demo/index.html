		<p>We currently use Adobe Flash to produce CBT (Computer Based Training). All CBT has a full audio track and this is very time consuming
		(i.e. expensive) to produce and update. The audio track is often just reading out text that is already on the screen.
		There is little animation used and hardly any interactivity. The Flash CBT is also not compatible with most tablets. iPads will not display any Flash,
		some Android devices will, but most do not.</p>
	
		<div class="heading">HTML is the Answer?</div>
		
		<p>We could build our CBT in HTML and only use audio where appropriate. This would have the following advantages:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Much faster to build.</li>
			<li>Easier to update.</li>
			<li>Compatible with all devices capable of displaying a web page.</li>
			<li>Smaller overall file sizes<ul>
				<li>Faster to view online.</li>
				<li>Less server space / bandwidth required.</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Easier to make CBT, books and CAI have the same look, i.e. use the same graphics and layout.</li>
			<li>No plugnis required to view CBT (unless we use choose to use plugins within the HTML).</li>
			<li>We would not be dependant on Adobe to produce / maintain Flash.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<div class="sub-heading">Disadvantages of HTML</div>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Animation is much harder to do, unless we use embedded Flash or video.</li>
			<li>Syncing content to audio is harder to do.</li>
			<li>Content is potentially easier to steal.</li>
			<li>Content could not be protected on CD-ROMs.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<div class="heading">Future of CD-ROMs?</div>
		
		<p>Physical media, i.e. CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs are becomming less widely used. As with floppy drives, it is likely that computers will
		stop being sold with optical drives at some point in the future (this is still a way off, I guess 5 years+). The internet is more and more
		common and I do not think it is unreasonable for us to move to online only delivery.</p>
		
		<div class="sub-heading">Advantages of Online Only Delivery</div>
		
		<ul>
			<li>We sell direct to customers, no re-sellers taking a cut, we make more money.</li>
			<li>The second-hand market is wiped out, potentially driving more customers to us.</li>
			<li>No manufacturing costs.</li>
			<li>No warehouse required to hold stock.</li>
			<li>Content updates are instant and easy to manage - we only have to update files on a server.</li>
		</ul>
