		<div class="page-title">Answer Boxes</div>		
		
		<p>To add an answer box you need to include <b>interactive.css</b> and <b>interactive.js</b>:</p>
		
		<textarea class="code" rows="4"><head>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="../../javascript/lib.js"></script>
	<script>write_head();include_css('interactive.css');include_javascript('interactive.js');</script>
</head></textarea>

		<p>Any interactivity that requires the user to enter an answer should use the standard answer box:</p>
		
		<textarea class="code" rows="4"><div class="content_center">		
	<input id="answer" type="number" style="margin: 20px; text-align: center;" /><span id="output"></span><br />
	<button class="button" onclick="submit()">Submit</button>			
</div></textarea>
		
		<p>This produces....</p>
		
		<div class="content_center">		
			<input id="answer" type="number" style="margin: 20px; text-align: center;" /><span id="output"></span><br />
			<button class="button" onclick="submit()">Submit</button>			
		</div>
		
		<div class="heading"> Submitting Answers</div>
		
		<p>The standard answer box is set up to call the function <b>submit</b>; you will need to write this depending on your
		specific requirements. In the example above, the correct answer is '42', this is the code for the submit function:</p>
		
		<textarea class="code" rows="19">function submit ()
{
		
	var correct_answer = 42;
		
	var answer = $('#answer').val() * 1.0;
	answer = answer.toFixed(2);
		
	if (answer == correct_answer) {
			
		indicate_correct();
			
	} else {
			
		indicate_wrong();
			
	}
				
}</textarea>
		
		<p>The functions <b>indicate_correct()</b> and <b>indicate_wrong()</b> are includeded in interactive.js.</p>
		
		<div class="heading">Dealing with Numbers</div>
		
		<p>The data obtained from the input box is a <b>string</b>. In the example above, the correct answer is 42, a <b>number</b>.
		You will need to be mindful of data types when you are comparing them. A quick way to convert a string to a number is to multiple
		by 1.0. This line reads data from the input box and converts it to a number:</p>
		
		<textarea class="code" rows="1">var answer = $('#answer').val() * 1.0;</textarea>
		
		<div class="heading">Dealing with Decimals</div>
		
		<p>You will also need to be mindful of decimals - particularly if the correct answer is generated by an equation. This code sets a
		number to 2 decimal places:</p>
		
		<textarea class="code" rows="1">answer = answer.toFixed(2);</textarea>
		
		<p>To see the effect of this, enter '42' in the answer box above and click submit. You will be marked as correct, as you should
		expect. Now enter '42.01'. This is marked as wrong, as you should expect; 42 != 42.01. Now enter '42.001'. This will be marked as
		correct. Although 42 != 42.001, 42.001 to 2 decimal places (toFixed(2)) is 42.</p>
